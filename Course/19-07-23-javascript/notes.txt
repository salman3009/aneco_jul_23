function 
    - Reusing the code functionality 
    - if you call the function and you need to return the value
    -if function is returning the value means we need to store in variable

Array:
     -Storing the data continously inside the memory.
     -access,removing,updating,deleting easily we can able to do
Methods:
     1.unshift/push
     2.shift/pop
     3.slice - original array will remain as it is.
     4.splice - original array will change
     5.indexOf 
     6.join 
     7.includes 
     8.reverse

What is function callback?
 A function is called after sometime. 
 Implementation: you can pass function as parameter to another function and from there you can execute it.

loops 
   //to iterate the data 
    for loop 
    for of loop 

map:
   //mapping the data 
   //to iterate the array and we can able to do some modifications and it will return new array.

String methods 
    1.toUpperCase()
    2.toLowerCase()
    3.indexOf()
    4.charAt()
    5.trim()
    6.slice()

//some methods is available only on string/array 
array to string --> [].toString() or [].join()
string to array -->split().join()

array iteration can happen using for of loop 
object iteration can happen using for for in loop
