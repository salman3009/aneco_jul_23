Reactjs
1.funtional component - latest 
2.class component - old version 
=================================
class component  - code is lengthy
class component - more concept.
Initial days we don't have hooks(useState,useEffect) so state is only possible with class component.
==================================
import {Component} from react;

class FormInput extends Component{

    constructor(props){
	   super(props);
	   this.state={
	     display:"string"
	   };
	}
	
	render(){
	   return()
	}

}

//you can have only one state variable and inside that you can declare multiple values.

//render method we need to use it for return 

Inbuilt methods: (normal method) or lifecycle methods
1.constructor - to initialize state - 1
2.render - to return jsx; - 2
3.shouldComponentUpdate - to get update state everytime.whenever state is updated this method will be called again and again. - 4
4.componentDidMount - to call this method only one time used for api get call - 3
other methods:
1.any custom method please write using arrow method.

======================================
Accessing state and props and methods 
//please use the this keyword 
To update the state:
//please use setState method and which property you need to update please update that particular property only.
============================================
class component and functional component 
Both can be used together:
Initial Days:
1.whenever they have state they will use class component. react hooks is not present at that time.
2.whenver they have stateless component they will use functional component
3.react hooks is present from 16.9 onwards
==========================================
Lifecyclhooks:
useEffect(()=>{},[]) --> only one time during initial rendering 
componentDidMount()--->only one time during initial rendering 
==============================================
useEffect(()=>{},[state]) -->whenever state changes happen it will call this event 
shouldComponentUpdate()-->whenever state changes happen it will call this event
===============================================
