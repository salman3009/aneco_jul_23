Reactjs:
//any image and icon you need to display means we have to import dynamically inside the react.
//With react application you can write without bootstrap as well.
Routing:
//As SPA we don't have multiple html we have only one html 
//So React will use only one html and it render different component depends upon url mapping.
//Url mapping to be work we need to use routing mechanism.
Step1:
cmd:npm install react-router-dom 
step2:
App.js 
import {BrowserRouter,Routes,Route} from 'react-router-dom';
function App() {
  return (
   <div>
     <BrowserRouter>
     <Header/>
     <Routes>
     <Route path="" element={<Register/>}></Route>
     <Route path="login" element={<Login/>}></Route>
     </Routes>
     </BrowserRouter>
    </div>
  );
}
